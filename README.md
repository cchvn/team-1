# Among patients with Hospital Acquired Infection, are there discrepancies in rates of mortality and risk of ICU admission/readmission, compared across gender, race/ethnicity, and language preference?
##   Team 1 

### Motivation : 
- Per the CDC, on any given day: 1 in 31 hospital patients has a healthcare-associated infection(1) 
- Healthcare disparities represent a significant challenge in the quest for equitable health outcomes across different population

Are the harms of HAI equally distributed across subgroups?
